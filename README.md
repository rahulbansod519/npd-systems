# Npd-Systems

In the final year of engineering, developed the number plate detection system(4 members in a team), and I
helped to create the TensorFlow number plate detection model which will be able to detect number plates
on cars.
this project is mainly focused on detecting the number plate from cars and storing the extracted number
from number plates and capturing dates and times in a database.
the technology used in the projects is Python, Flask as a backend framework, TensorFlow for detection of
the number plate, EasyOcr (OCR library) for extracting letters or numbers from number plate, and
PHPMyAdmin database for storing numbers, dates, and time.
